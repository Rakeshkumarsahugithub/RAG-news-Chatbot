    "title": "A court blocked a migrant being returned to France - how much of a setback is this for No 10?",
    "description": "The temporary decision by a High Court judge shows how complicated deportation or removal plans can be.",
    "content": "Just one stumbling block for one migrant? Or something much more serious which threatens the government's approach to small boats? Those are the questions being posed in government now after a 25-year-old Eritrean man managed to block the government from putting him on a flight to France at the High Court on Tuesday. It is just a temporary decision. The judge granted a pause of at least 14 days so the man, who is not being named for legal reasons and arrived in the UK on a small boat last month, could provide evidence of his claim that he has been a victim of modern day slavery. But it is certainly frustrating for a government which had hoped that the removal flights to France under the 'one in, one out' scheme would begin this week. They may still do so. Either way, the steady drumbeat of people being put on flights through the week appears not to have materialised. The stumbling blocks with Tuesday's case show how complicated quick turn-around deportation or removal plans can be. And in this case, they concern the UK's laws on modern day slavery and trafficking - and the way the Home Office handles these cases. After the man arrived on a small boat in August, officials swiftly rejected his case and told him he could and should have claimed asylum in France. But he also asked for protection as a victim of modern day slavery, saying he has suffered harm in Libya, long before he came to the UK. There was no evidence he was trafficked across the Channel, not least because his mother had paid smugglers about £1,000 to take him. Now, here's the important twist. The Home Office's trafficking assessors - different officials to the team organising removal flights - said the Eritrean man's story was weak. But that rejection was not their final decision. The UK's rules allow a rejected applicant to ask for a reconsideration. The senior judge dealing with the case repeatedly asked the man's lawyers why he could not make those representations from France, including gathering any medical evidence. It looked and sounded like the Home Office was going to win. But then, as the courtroom battle dragged on, the department's own trafficking officials effectively confirmed that they would not expect the man to do that. That fatally undermined any hope the home secretary had of getting this 25-year-old on the 9am flight from London Heathrow. If the Home Office wasn't such a secure bomb-proof building, we might have been able to hear howls from its ministerial corridors echo around the Royal Courts of Justice, two miles away. So where does this decision leave the project? This single decision does not kill the France returns plan, but it's symptomatic of a decades-long criticism, that the Home Office regularly snatches defeat from the jaws of victory thanks to epic levels of dysfunction. Yes, the government never committed publicly to flights in the air this week. But in private, there was a strong expectation from those around Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, of a string of departures this week. But immigration is complicated - really complicated - and the awkwardness of Tuesday's injunction aside, officials know other English Channel crossers may mount similar arguments. The government's own KC argued in court that if the judge blocked this removal, as he went on to do, then \"the deterrent effect of this policy will be undermined\". Anyone who presents a reasonable argument that they might have been a victim of trafficking is entitled to at least 45 days to \"recover and reflect\" - with a final decision on their case maybe a year down the road. If this claimant gets that positive decision, he could be off the removal list for a year on top of that as he waits a final outcome. The political risk for the government is that their own lawyer is now proved right, not least because so many arriving on small boats have travelled through countries like Libya where trafficking and abuse are rife. It is too soon to say conclusively whether Tuesday's interim judgment means that this scheme will get bogged down in repeated legal action like the Conservatives' proposed Rwanda policy, which never got off the ground before being cancelled by Sir Keir Starmer 14 months ago when he entered office. The Conservatives, though, see vindication in the development. Their leader, Kemi Badenoch, told LBC that her message for the government was: \"We told you so.\" Science Secretary Liz Kendall told BBC Breakfast that scheme was not intended as a \"silver bullet\" and this single ruling would \"not stop this really important deal from going ahead\". The deal with France was seen by the previous home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as one of her landmark policy achievements, it is now the job of her successor, Mahmood, to make it work. Mahmood is seen at the government as a punchier communicator - displayed, perhaps, in her opening vow as home secretary to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration. Her colleagues will be hoping she is not having to deploy those communication skills at the end of the week to explain why no-one has been flown to France yet.

    "title": "Thousands of Palestinians flee as Israeli troops push into Gaza City",
    "description": "Israel says its aim is to defeat up to 3,000 Hamas fighters who remain there, but the offensive has drawn international condemnation.",
    "content": "Thousands of Palestinians are continuing to flee Gaza City, as Israel's major ground offensive aimed at occupying the area enters a second day. Israel says its aim is to free hostages held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it describes as the group's \"last stronghold\", but the offensive has drawn widespread international condemnation. The leaders of more than 20 major aid agencies, including Save the Children and Oxfam, warned that \"the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable\". It comes a day after a UN commission of inquiry concluded that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza - an allegation the Israeli government strongly denied. Amid large-scale Israeli bombardment, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said al-Rantisi children's hospital in Gaza City was targeted in three separate Israeli attacks on Tuesday night, prompting around half its patients to leave. A source at the hospital said there were no injuries but that air conditioning units, water tanks and solar panels were severely damaged. \"This hospital is the only specialist facility for children with cancer, kidney failure, and other life-threatening conditions,\" said Fikr Shalltoot, Gaza director of the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was looking into the reports. The IDF announced on Wednesday morning that it had struck more than 150 targets across Gaza City in two days in support of its ground troops. As part of its operations, the IDF is also reportedly utilising old military vehicles loaded with explosives that have been modified to be controlled remotely. They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media. Resident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: \"Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn.\" \"Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya. It was a very, very frightening night.\" For days - as Israel has ramped up strikes in and around the city - huge columns of Palestinians have streamed southwards in donkey carts, rickshaws, vehicles strapped high with belongings, and on foot. Until now, they have been forced to flee down the main coastal road to an Israel-designated \"humanitarian area\" in al-Mawasi. But on Wednesday, the IDF announced that it would temporarily open a second route for people to travel on - the central Salah al-Din road. It said the route would be open for 48 hours from 12:00 local time (10:00 BST). Many Palestinians say they are unable to move south due to the rising costs associated with the journey. Some say renting a small truck now costs the equivalent of £660 ($900), while a tent for five people sells for about £880 ($1,200). Aid groups, UN agencies and others say the \"humanitarian area\" they are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly two million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it. Some who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents and so returned north. \"Everyday leaflets are thrown at us ordering evacuation, while the Israeli army shells buildings in every direction,\" Munir Azzam, who is in northern Gaza, told the BBC. \"But where can we go? We have no refuge in the South.\" The IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August. Estimates suggest at least 650,000 remain. Gaza's health ministry said on Wednesday that 98 people had been killed and 385 injured by Israeli fire in the past 24 hours. Another four people had died from malnutrition, taking the total number of malnutrition-related deaths since a UN-backed body declared famine in Gaza City in late August to 154, it added. Meanwhile, families of the 48 remaining hostages held by Hamas - 20 of whom are believed to be alive - protested near Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem on Tuesday and Wednesday, arguing that the offensive would endanger their loved ones. \"All day long, you boast about killing and destruction,\" said Macabit Mayer, aunt of hostages Gali and Ziv Berman. \"Bringing down buildings in Gaza - who are you bringing these buildings down on?\" Pope Leo XIV meanwhile said conditions for Palestinians in Gaza were \"unacceptable\" and repeated his call for a ceasefire. \"I am deeply close to the Palestinian people of Gaza, who continue to live in fear and under unacceptable conditions, forced yet again to leave their land,\" he told his weekly audience at the Vatican. Elsewhere, the European Union's main executive body, the European Commission, proposed imposing sanctions on Israel over its conduct during the Gaza war and its decision to advance the E1 settlement project, which would effectively divide the occupied West Bank in two. The proposal includes suspending some trade-related provisions of the EU's association agreement with Israel, as well as sanctions on \"extremist ministers\" in the Israeli government and violent Israeli settlers. The settlements are illegal under international law. Israel has warned the EU not to impose the measures, which do not currently have sufficient support from member states to pass. Among the findings of the UN commission of inquiry's report which concluded that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza was that Israeli security forces had perpetrated sexual and gender-based violence, directly targeted children with the intention to kill them, and carried out a \"systemic and widespread attack\" on religious, cultural and education sites. Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\". Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 65,062 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry. With famine having already been declared in Gaza City by a UN-backed food security body, the UN has warned that an intensification of the offensive will push civilians into \"even deeper catastrophe\".

    "title": "Scotland's not proven verdict to be scrapped as MSPs back reforms",
    "description": "The verdict has been used in criminal trials for hundreds of years but campaigners had called for it to be abolished.",
    "content": "Plans to scrap Scotland's controversial not proven verdict have been approved by MSPs. The move is part of wide-ranging justice reforms which will also increase the threshold for a guilty verdict in jury trials and create a special sexual offences court. The removal of the not proven verdict, which is unique to Scottish courts and can be traced back to the 17th Century, will be a major milestone in the country's legal history. Its supporters argue that it reduces the risk of wrongful conviction – but critics say the verdict is confusing and fails to provide closure for victims. The reforms were included in the government's Victims, Witnesses and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill, which passed by 71 votes to 46. Not proven is one of three verdicts that can be returned in Scotland's criminal courts, alongside guilty and not guilty. It has the same effect as being found not guilty - the accused is acquitted and is innocent in the eyes of the law. There have been repeated calls to abolish not proven in recent decades, often prompted by families of victims who have been left aggrieved by what they perceive as an unfair verdict. There is no set definition of not proven in law. At the start of a criminal trial, jurors are told that there are two acquittal verdicts - but it is not explained how they differ. Justice Secretary Angela Constance said it was a \"widely misunderstood\" verdict that \"traumatises\" victims and leaves a \"lingering stigma on the accused\". However, the Law Society of Scotland has argued that its removal risks an increase in miscarriages of justice. A study published in 2019 said removing the not proven verdict might incline more jurors towards a guilty verdict in finely balanced trials. It also highlighted inconsistent views on the meaning of not proven and how it differed from not guilty. The latest Scottish government figures, for 2022/23, show that 1% of people facing criminal charges in court were acquitted on a not proven verdict, compared to 4% on a not guilty verdict. The reforms in the government's bill also include a change in how guilty verdicts are decided. Scottish juries have 15 members and at present a simple majority of eight jurors is required for a verdict. Under the new two-thirds rule, that will be raised to 10 out of 15 jurors. Raising the bar for guilty verdicts is intended to allay the concerns of some defence lawyers who fear the the abolition of the not proven verdict could increase the risk of wrongful convictions. The reforms also pave the way for: Ministers have not set a timetable for scrapping the not proven verdict or introducing a two-thirds majority for guilty verdicts. These changes will require judges and court staff to undergo training. It could take significantly longer to set up a sexual offences court and a victims commissioner. Most rape cases reported to police do not lead to prosecutions. To address this, ministers proposed a pilot scheme that would have allowed trials for serious sexual offences to be held without a jury and decided by a single judge. However, this measure was dropped following criticism from lawyers and judges. Victim Support Scotland chief executive Kate Wallace said the passage of the bill was a \"momentous occasion\". \"It marks a significant step towards creating a system that considers and prioritises the needs of people impacted by crime,\" she said. Rape Crisis chief executive Sandy Brindley welcomed the removal of the not proven verdict, which she said had \"let down\" victims. However, she also expressed \"serious concerns\" about the increase to the jury majority and \"the negative effect that this will almost certainly have on rape and sexual offence cases\". The Law Society of Scotland said it supported the creation of a victims commissioner and the granting of automatic lifelong anonymity for victims of sexual offences. But it warned that introducing \"untested\" changes to the justice system could raise the risk of miscarriages of justice. Stuart Munro, convener of the society's Criminal Law Committee, said: \"Every legal system with a two-verdict system requires a unanimous or near unanimous jury to convict, whereas Scotland will now have a system where a person can be convicted despite five members of the jury having significant doubts about their guilt.\" The bill was supported by SNP, Liberal Democrat and Green MSPs. Constance said the legislation would \"put victims and witnesses at the heart of a modern and fair justice system\". Greens justice spokeswoman Maggie Chapman told MSPs it would help deliver \"compassion, dignity and justice for victims\". While there was broad agreement in parliament over abolishing the not proven verdict, Conservative and Labour MSPs voted against the bill. They raised objections to pushing through such a wide range of measures in one bill and being given limited time to debate complex amendments. Tory MSP Sharon Dowry said the legislation would \"waste millions on cosmetic solutions that will make little difference to victims\". Labour justice spokeswoman Pauline McNeill raised concerns about taking serious sexual offence cases out of the high court and into a specialist court. Her colleague Katy Clark added that the bill was \"far too large\" and that several amendments received too little scrutiny.",

    "title": "Obama says US faces 'political crisis' after killing of Charlie Kirk",
    "description": "The former president criticised the response to the shooting by President Trump, who has vowed to tackle \"radical leftists\".",
    "content": "Former US President Barack Obama has warned of a \"political crisis of the sort that we haven't seen before\" in the wake of the killing of Charlie Kirk. At an event in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Obama said he did not know Kirk and disagreed with many of his views, but called the killing \"horrific and a tragedy\". He criticised Donald Trump's remarks towards his political opponents and pointed to previous Republican presidents who, he said, emphasised national unity in moments of high tension, US media report. In response, the White House called Obama the \"architect of modern political division\". Kirk, 31, died of a single gunshot wound while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem on 10 September. On Tuesday, Tyler Robinson, 22, was formally charged with Kirk's murder, weapons offenses and other charges. Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty. Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray said Robinson had sent text messages which allegedly said he shot Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred\". Before Robinson was captured, top Trump allies pinned blame for the killing on left-wing activists and rhetoric from Democratic lawmakers and their supporters. Attorney General Pam Bondi has suggested that the administration will crack down on \"hate speech\" – although there is no specific US hate speech law. Vice-President JD Vance has led calls to expose people who celebrated or condoned Kirk's killing or were critical of him after his slaying. \"Call them out, and hell, call their employer,\" Vance said as he guest-hosted Kirk's podcast. Speaking in Erie, Pennsylvania, Obama said: \"I think at moments like this, when tensions are high, then part of the job of the president is to pull people together.\" He urged Americans to \"respect other people's right to say things that we profoundly disagree with\". Obama praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox, a conservative Republican who he said had shown \"that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate\". He also endorsed the response of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, whose official residence was firebombed earlier this year in what police called a targeted attack. The former president contrasted those reactions with comments made by Trump and his allies. Obama said that he did not use a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist at a black church in South Carolina to go after his political enemies, and pointed out that after the 11 September 2001 attacks, President George W Bush \"explicitly went out of his way to say, 'We are not at war against Islam'.\" \"And so when I hear not just our current president, but his aides, who have a history of calling political opponents 'vermin', enemies who need to be 'targeted,' that speaks to a broader problem that we have right now and something that we're going to have to grapple with, all of us,\" Obama told the crowd, according to reports. In a statement to the BBC, a White House spokesperson rejected the allegations and accused Obama of stoking division while he was president. \"Obama used every opportunity to sow division and pit Americans against each other,\" the spokesperson said. \"His division has inspired generations of Democrats to slander their opponents as 'deplorables,' or 'fascists,' or 'Nazis.'\" After leaving office, US presidents generally tend to temper criticism of their successors, however in recent months Obama has hit out at Trump's moves against universities and judges, and has also criticised Democratic party leaders for failing to push back harder against White House policies.",

    "title": "Tests show Navalny was poisoned in jail, his widow says",
    "description": "Yulia Navalnaya is urging the two laboratories she says found her husband was poisoned to release their findings.",
    "content": "The wife of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has said he was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024. In a video shared on social media, Yulia Navalnaya said analysis of smuggled biological samples carried out by laboratories in two countries showed that her husband had been \"murdered\". She did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results. Navalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47. In 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia. At the time of his death he had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to a penal colony in the Arctic Circle. Navalny's supporters and colleagues at his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) have always maintained the Russian government was involved in his demise. Navalnaya said that after her husband's death in February 2024 his team were able to \"obtain and securely transfer\" biological samples abroad and that two laboratories in different countries had concluded he had been poisoned. She did not share the location of the laboratories - but she implied that they were not making their findings public due to \"political considerations\". \"They don't want an inconvenient truth to surface at the wrong time,\" she said. Navalnaya also suggested she would get pushback on trying to investigate her husband's death further: \"'You are the wife, of course, but there is no criminal case, there are no legal grounds to hand documents to you.'\" \"But I have grounds. Not legal, but moral grounds.\" She added that Navalny had been her husband, friend and closest person – and \"a symbol of hope for a better future for our country\". \"I know he was a symbol to you too,\" she said over images of Navalny's Moscow funeral which drew thousands despite warnings from the authorities not to attend. \"I will not be silent. I affirm that Vladimir Putin is guilty of killing my husband, Alexei Navalny... I urge the laboratories which conducted studies to make the results public.\" On Wednesday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of Navalnaya's statements. In the video, Navalnaya also detailed her husband's last days based on what she said was testimony by employees at the penal colony, which the BBC has not been able to verify. According to her, on the day he died Navalny was taken out for a walk but felt ill. When he was taken back to his cell \"he lay down on the floor, pulled his knees up, and started moaning in pain... then he started vomiting\". \"Alexei was having convulsions... the prison guards watched [his] agony through the bars of the cell window,\" she said, citing the alleged testimonies. An ambulance wasn't called until 40 minutes after Navalny became ill, his widow said, and he died shortly after. Prison authorities told his mother Lyudmila that her son had experienced \"sudden death syndrome\". Later, state investigators said the death had been caused by a medical condition and arrythmia. Navalny's associates have shared previously unseen images on social media purporting to show his cell on the day he died and the tiny exercise yard where he was allowed out. Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\". The Russian president also said he had agreed to a planned prisoner swap between Navalny and \"some people\" held in Western jails, on condition that Navalny did not come back to Russia. \"But such is life. There's nothing to be done about it,\" Putin said. It is highly unlikely Moscow will issue any further comment on Navalny's death. His popularity and internet savviness long rattled the Kremlin, while senior figures were irritated by his investigations into high-profile government corruption. With Navalny's death Russia lost the last towering opposition figure who challenged Putin's rule. Many of his associates have been jailed or have fled Russia. Navalnaya herself faces arrest, and she and her two children live abroad. The crackdown on civil society ramped up further following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and punitive new laws leading to mass arrests have muzzled any opposition. In both life and death Navalny managed to draw out huge crowds onto the streets. Thousands of mourners turned out for his funeral in Moscow in March 2024 despite well-founded fears of a police crackdown. No large opposition gatherings have taken place in Russia since.",
